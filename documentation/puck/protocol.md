This doc defines the **Puck wire protocol expressed in JSON** — the
message structures and behaviors that a Puck server and client
agree on when speaking JSON over HTTP.

The conceptual overview is in [puck.md](puck.md); a Python client
sketch is in [python.md](python.md); this doc is the formal spec.

JSON is the primary wire format. Puck can also be expressed in HTML.
The HTML expression is described separately in
[puck-html.md](puck-html.md); JSON and HTML formats are convertible
losslessly.

**Status: in development.**

## 1 Class definition

A Puck class is defined in JSON, using the **same shape Charlie and
Mikobase use** (see [class-definition.md](../charlie/class-definition.md)
for the full Mikobase/Charlie spec). Here's `puck.uno/geo`:

```json
{
    "name": "puck.uno/geo",
    "fields": {
        "lat": {"class": "number", "required": true},
        "lon": {"class": "number", "required": true}
    }
}
```

Two required number fields — `lat` and `lon`. An instance is
constructed by supplying values for these fields.
